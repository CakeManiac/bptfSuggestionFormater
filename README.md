# bptfSuggestionFormater
lets you format bptf suggestions easily (and quickly)

put n behind your item's name
|i behind item links
|s behind sales
and 
|t behind total (see data.txt for example)
then run main.py and your formated suggestion will be in a new file called out.txt (or copy from console)

the stuff in data.txt will give u this to directly paste in bptf:
